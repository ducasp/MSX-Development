v3.9.2plus Ducasp's Unofficial Release \___________________________________________________________________________

v3.9.2plus [2024.XX.YY] [Ducasp Updates!]

- Up to speed with KdL 3.9.2.
- Improvements on SN76489 (where applicable): latest version from Jotego that fixes bad sound on SMS Populous, now
  it is muted upon reset so no note get stuck.
- Picked up SMS VDP fixes from MiSTER repository for better reliability / results.
- Fixed SMS VDP running 3,3% faster on SM-X / SM-X Mini / SX-2 and SM-X HB (some monitors wouldn't display SMS
  image due to Vertical Refresh of 62Hz and games were running a tad faster).
- SMB-HB using Franky, unfortunately PSG2 had to go to leave room for extra updates, sorry!
- Improvement on OPLL / MSX Music: it now supports test register bit 2 functionality, phase hold, which is used by
  Grauw's FMPCM application.

v3.9.1plus [2023.12.20] [Ducasp Updates!]

- Up to speed with KdL 3.9.1 REPACK.
- Now we have three flavors: regular (no extension), Franky (franky extension) and Sound (snd extension). Regular
  only has the emulated paddle over PS/2 mouse and the changes in the below items. Franky adds Sega Master System
  PSG and VDP working as Franky add-on built-in (setsmart -8c will reserve I/O addresses that switched I/O might
  use for Franky usage, will work too if no switched I/O is selected) at the expense of not having OPL3. Sound has
  Sega Master System PSG working as Franky (but not the VDP, setsmart works the same) and keeps OPL3, so if OPL3
  is important for you you can use the extra SMS PSG on VGMPLAY, COL4MMM (disk version) and SG1000 emulator.
- Grabbed some updates from 3.9.2 alpha (lfantoniosi VDP updates, latest bios with latest Nextor, new IPL module
  that doesn't use flash memory in MC2P build).
- Reverted back to old mouse handling (no sensitivity change) as it was not working with all PS/2 mouses, it only
  has the fix to allow 1 pixel movement on X axis, like original OCM 3.9.1 mouse. Should return that feature once
  I get more mouses to test and be able to get it working with mouses that did not work with it.
- Using 3.9.0 PS2 controller, I think that most people with SM-X / SX2 already have a keyboard that works, and they
  do not have know-how / time / will to update their hardware with the proposed hardware changes, and without it
  there is a risk that some keyboards might not work nice with the new PS2 controller (mine and most worked fine,
  so while I'm being conservative, KdL and Hara updates should be good for most people). I've opted to keep the old
  controller for now (I might be wrong on my understanding of the PS2 new controller requiring the hardware changes
  though, but I think for now I would rather play safe).

________________________________
v3.x KdL/HRA's Official Release \__________________________________________________________________________________


v3.9.2 [2023.12.13] [KdL's Updates!] [ALPHA12]
- New PS/2 keyboard interface for OCM-PLD/OCM-Kai, by HRA! (2022.12.24) ### TODO: MICE NEEDS IMPROVEMENT ###
- Added an alternate source code to have VGA Scanlines on 1chipMSX instead of the MIDI device. (2023.02.24)
- Fixed the ability to disable some modules like Wi-Fi, MIDI, OPL3 and the Intenal PSG2. (2023.02.25)
- Replaced the T800 core of the 2nd Gen machines with the T80 core of the MSX MiST project. (2023.04.04)
- Reverted the separation of the T800 and T80 cores since a parameter was adopted to disable MULUs. (2023.05.15)
- Improved Autofire toggle and interaction of LEDs with OCM indicator. (2023.05.16)
- Added the key combination CTRL+SHIFT+F12 to perform Cold Reset from the keyboard. (2023.05.17)
- Fixed IPL-ROM on VDP initialization. Updated the '*_no_epcs_icon.hex' that did not show the SD icon. (2023.05.29)
- Sprite multiplex fix by Luis Felipe Antoniosi and improved timing in the drawing of sprites. (2023.06.11)
- New M File Manager v4.0 (2023.03.18) in the [msxtools\] folder. (2023.06.13)
- Slightly improved cpu clock 5.37 MHz to get better experience with some games. (2023.08.09)
- Updated Intel Quartus Prime Lite Edition to version 23.1 and Nextor kernel to version 2.1.2 (2023.12.13)

v3.9.1 [2022.11.27] [KdL's Updates!] [REPACK]

- Updated some scripts, now the entire multi-release group is aborted if a single task fails.
- Improved IPL-ROM to use many more brands of SD cards, new animated icons and minor fixes, by HRA! and me.
- Improved PS/2 keyboard controller for the 2nd Gen machines with expanded compatibility, by HRA!
  ### NOTICE: some keyboards that did not work previously can now be used, but without the use of LEDs.
  ### This condition is normal for SM-X and SX-2 machines that do not yet have the hardware patch on the PS/2 port.
- Improved T80 core in which a bug that prevented the Lilly's Saga game from working properly was fixed, by HRA!
- Careful SEED selection for the 1st Gen machines was carried out through the collaboration of Emiliano Olea Lucas.

v3.9.1 [2022.09.24] [KdL's Updates!]

- This is the first official firmware for MSX++ machines, the MSX++ logo is now the default logo for the 1chipMSX
  and replace the previous unofficial MSX3 logo. The other homebrew machines will continue to show their own logo.
- Updated Switched I/O ports ($40-$4F) module to Revision 11:
  new Dynamic Port 4B that extends the I/O capacity by an additional 254 sub-ports based on the value of port $44;
  new smart command "Reserve OCM-BIOS Reloading" useful for managing several SDBIOS without turning off the power;
  new Extra-Mapper 4096kB on Slot0-1 actionable by GETRESET or SETSMART commands for all machines with at least
  16MB SDRAM, the size of system RAM can now be selected from 2048kB, 4096kB, 6144kB and 8192kB;
  new Internal PSG2 (acting as an external PSG) for 2nd Gen machines only, PSG2 logic was implemented by Ducasp;
  improved access to tPANA on port $41 ID $08, so that the 5.37 MHz cpu clock is handled properly by most programs.
- Updated documentation in the [docs\] folder, added the "startup processing v3.9.1" by HRA!, which explains
  the meaning of the new icons that appear at pre-boot: by reading it you can have a better user experience!
- Updated 'mglocm.com' v2.3b (2022.09.11) in the [msxtools\mglunch\] folder with the Internal PSG2, by ToughkidCST.
- Updated 'vgmplay.com' v1.3 (final release) in the [msxtools\vgmplay\] folder, by Grauw.
- Updated 'mpcm.com' v1.07 in the [msxtools\mpcm\] folder which officially includes a new OCM patch, by Niga.
  For those who prefer to use their own external memory mappers, the previous MPCM v1.06 is recommended.
- Updated and revised all the scripts to compile and collect firmware, improving reliability and performance.
- New 'testinap.asc' tool in the [msxtools\diags\] folder, allows you to test pull-up resistors of external slots.
- New and improved MegaSD (SD controller) in Verilog with support for initialization in fast or slow mode, by HRA!
- New IPL-ROM 3.00, the Initial Program Loader has changed and includes the new pre-boot icons, there is a new way
  of loading SDBIOS which is now based on the filename, the possibility of activating multiple SDBIOS on the same
  SD card, better error checking, many months of testing and modification by HRA! with my collaboration.
- New PS/2 keyboard controller in Verilog by HRA!, improved stability and recognition of keyboards but in some
  cases a hardware patch will be needed on 2nd Gen machines (SM-X and SX-2), see documentation.
- Improved and revised keymap ROM tables, the new Italian layout is only precompiled for 2nd Gen machines, I fixed
  each layout by creating a spreadsheet that you can find in the [esemsx3\src\peripheral\keymap_work\] folder.
- Improved the Internal OPL3 for the 2nd Gen machines, IRQ and scaler timer have been fixed, and in addition,
  mono audio has been reprogrammed to achieve small space in the FPGA, by Ducasp.
- Improved SDRAM controller to support chips smaller than 32MB, this changes made the design more flexible and
  extensible, the request came from Ducasp to implement his custom firmware.
- Improved I/O access times on the external bus at 10.74 MHz and fixed PS/2 mouse movement on the horizontal axis.
- Improved the reset button timer and fixed the logo speed limiter, the timings was reanalyzed and adjusted.
- Fixed some issues on PSG wave, turboR PCM Device, 5 Tap FIR low-pass filter, VDP R#8 and YJK modes, by HRA!
- Fixed the sound spikes on the speakers when pressing the reset button (at last!), the cause was the PWM reset.
- Optimizations and code cleanup, all shared variables were converted to logical signals, as suggested by uniabis.
- Quartus II v13.0sp1 Web Edition was updated to Intel Quartus Prime Lite Edition v21.1.1 for the 2nd Gen machines.
- This version of OCM-PLD includes a total of fifty-four precompiled firmware variants.
  Firmware interchangeability groups are highlighted in the 'details.txt' of the [firmware\] folder, as usual.
  SM-X Mini firmware will no longer be available because I do not have the opportunity to test that machine myself.
  For those who want to venture into compilation, the code has been archived in [ocm_sm\legacy-smxmini391-src.zip].

Notes and warnings:
- To get the best out of these firmware, IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED TO USE THE MOST UP-TO-DATE OCM-EXTRA TOOLS.
  An example of a bug fixed: the first version of the FIRMINFO command displayed the wrong I/O revision number 31.
- Nextor kernel is unable to flash the PLD firmware using the old 'pldload.com' and the machine can be BRICKED!!
  The current 'pldflash.com' and 'smxflash.com' are the only ones to do this, be very careful when using them.
- Nextor can now automatically mount the SD card even if it has not been inserted into the slot before system boot.
- The most of Microcabin games can run better with the 'runit.com' tool, with 'ep.com' two drives are required.
  If you experience issues using SofaRun, you may need to increase the loading delay from the game settings.
- Most of the features of the MSX turboR have not yet been developed and are for testing purposes only. The MULU
  opcodes and System Timer (S1990) are no longer available on the 1st Gen machines due to the space limit reached.
- Currently, the MIDI interface is limited to the operation of the MIDRY software and very few others.
- Philips Music Module does not support the tMegaSD function and only works at 3.58MHz, run SETSMART -030B40 to go.
- The main cause of instability in the 1st Gen machines is the option "Force Use of Synchronous Clear Signals".
  This option was introduced in OCM-PLD v2.4 and currently cannot be disabled due to running out of resources.
  In the 2nd Gen machines this option has been disabled and will not be used, so they are much more stable.
  Since this new generation does not need more space yet, the compression of the SOF has also been disabled.
  If necessary, it will still be possible to activate it by modifying the structure of the COF in this way:
  "<sof_filename>output_files/ocm_sm.sof<compress_bitstream>1</compress_bitstream></sof_filename>".
- On the 1st Gen machines the hard reset lock function does not work with cartridges due to a hardware limitation.
  A hardware patch can be made by isolating pin 15 of the slots from the reset button and connecting it to pin 16.
  This patch also requires custom firmware with the appropriate changes, so I do NOT recommend its use.
- The ESP8266 Wi-Fi BIOS has NOT been integrated into EPBIOS because its full maturity has not yet been reached.
- When Extra-Mapper 4096kB is enabled, you may encounter anomalies or system crashes with some software, as is the
  case with Micro Music v3.1, but this depends on how they were programmed. MPCM can handle all that RAM.

Some known issues:
- The sprites disable and enable after three lines instead of after one line, reported by Grauw and Andre.
- Some PSG sounds are not played accurately and sometimes the OPLL drum kit sounds too loud.
- The current version of MSX turboR BIOS can be started with Internal Mapper 4096kB only using Nextor kernel
  and generates some issues with the PSG output (simply just listen to the beep sound to confirm it).
- DIX game won't start due to INT_n inaccuracy, a temporary patch can run it by changing 00293h from C8h to 00h.
- The CMT input on 1st Gen machines causes an increase in video noise of VGA modes, slightly affecting luminance.

v3.9.x Ducasp's Unofficial Release \________________________________________________________________________________

v3.9d [2022.12.XX] [Ducasp Updates!]

- New SDRAM controller logic with additions from KdL over what Victor Trucco did, as Victor Version was based on
  3.7.1 OCM and not covering all scenarios, thanks KdL!
- SMX-HB joystick debounce is always enabled and option to turn it off is deprecated, as it did not help with
  joystick peripherals that weren't working with it.
- All devices now benefit from updated T800 core from Hara-san that fixes issues with Lilly's Adventure.

v3.9c [2022.06.XX] [Ducasp Updates!]

- New logic for mouse, allowing single pixel moviments on X axys.
- Support of MC2+.

v3.9b [2022.05.XX] [Ducasp Updates!]

- New SDRAM controller logic from Victor Trucco on all machines, should work for SM-X Mini and some SMX-HB.
- Second PSG support on Frankysnd variations.

v3.9a [2022.04.XX] [Ducasp Updates!]

- New machine added: SMX-HB, using EPC15 and a few differences due to it being a motherboard to be used inside a
  SHARP Hotbit case / Keyboard.
- New variants for SM-X (tested by me) and it's derivatives with EPC22, it has Franky support but it loses OPL3
  support.

________________________________
v3.x KdL/HRA's Official Release \__________________________________________________________________________________

v3.9 [2021.08.23] [KdL's Updates!]

- Updated Switched I/O ports ($40-$4F) module to Revision 10:
  new features dedicated to 2nd Gen machines, so SM-X and SX-2 can control Internal OPL3 and VGA Scalines.
  Removed the signal called "ZemmixNeo" in order to make the specification less constrained to the type of machine.
- Updated documentation in the [docs\] folder, including the "hardware patches to 2020.10.16" now summarized.
- Updated 'mglocm.com' v2.2a (2021.08.11) in the [msxtools\mglunch\] folder.
- Updated jic2pld converter which now allows you to auto-adapt the input files for EPCS16 and higher devices.
- Updated and revised all the scripts to compile and collect firmware. The 'zz5_set_synthesis_seed.cmd' script
  is used on the 1st Gen machines to generate random variants needed to re-enter when space limits are exceeded.
  Using this script also allows you to find better solutions than others, thus achieving system stability.
- New RESET model rewritten and parsed from zero. The new method improves the compatibility of external cartridges.
  Three actions are available: a short click <1s for a quick reset; a long click >1s that reloads SDBIOS; a click
  during the initial blinking allows you to cancel SDBIOS and force the use of EPBIOS without removing the SD card.
- New Autofire module, a function suggested by Konamiman currently only available for 2nd Gen machines, by HRA!
  The list of special keys has been updated as usual in the 'details.txt' of the [firmware\] folder.
- New F2 device designed by me to manage the operating states of the ESP8266 Wi-Fi BIOS implemented by Ducasp.
- Improved Wi-Fi module with Quick Receive support by Ducasp, LFSR counter and some minor optimizations.
- Improved System Timer (S1990) module with LFSR counter and reset command, based on the HRA! project.
- Improved and fixed RTC module by HRA! with some changes made by me like LFSR counter and rtcena signal.
- Improved some critical counters, now they are programmed separately if XTAL is 21.47727MHz or 50.00000MHz.
- Improved VDP wait controller, LMMV is reverted to normal speed in accordance with the current VDP update.
- Improved VDP R#23 for the text modes and added support for TEXTQ and MULTIQ modes, by HRA!
- Optimized turboR PCM Device with LFSR counter.
- Optimized CMT control on 2nd Gen machines, the SCRLK key has been re-mapped as a toggle for the Internal OPL3.
- Added Wi-Fi support for 1st Gen machines. A special USB Wi-Fi Header/Dongle with ESP-01 can then be connected to
  the USB port-1 of 1chipMSX, Zemmix Neo and SX-1 (the USB port-2 is used for the USB keyboard on some Zemmix Neo).
- Fixed damaged graphics in Fighter's Ragnarök game thanks to a bug fix in VDP R#17 management, by HRA!
  This fix solves various issues and allows you to successfully run games with the animated Sunrise logo.
- Separation of the T800 from the T80 thinking about the future R800 clone.
- Restructuring of the [ocm_sm\] folder now designed to quickly managed new 2nd Gen machines.
- Cleaned up the source code from parts of unused code and countless optimizations to reduce space.
- The firmware list has reached a total of sixty builds with the new SX-1 Mini/Mini+, SX-2 and SM-X Mini machines.
  Firmware interchangeability groups are now highlighted in the 'details.txt' of the [firmware\] folder.

v3.8.1 [2020.05.23] [KdL's Updates!]

- Updated documentation in the [docs\] folder and added the "hardware patch 2020.04.06" which shows which pull-up
  resistors must be replaced in the defective machines, in order to correctly use the external cartridges.
- Added MIDI output on joystick port-2 of the 1chipMSX and Zemmix Neo machines, a preliminary version like SM-X.
- Fixed the direction of the data bus on SM-X, now the external PSG cartridges work well, tested by ToughkidCST.
- The firmware are interchangeable only by machine type, therefore DO NOT mix 1chipMSX, Zemmix Neo and SM-X.

v3.8 [2020.01.09] [KdL's Updates!]
- Updated all keyboard layouts by adding KANA/CODE to the [MENU] key and fixed the assignment of [SHIFT+F6].
  Also, from this release, the UK layout is renamed to the US layout as it has always been incorrect.
- Updated documentation in the [docs\] folder.
- Updated 'vgmplay.com' v1.3-rc5 in the [msxtools\vgmplay\] folder.
- Updated some scripts to compile and collect firmware.
- New turboR PCM Device, initial release without a digital filter (LPF), by HRA!
  If using SDBIOS (MSX2+), version 2.8 or later must be loaded to enable PCM audio at system startup.
- New contents in the [msxtools\] folder, Read Silicon ID v1.1 and MPCM v1.04 / MPCM-OCM patch.
- Improved the global reset and some gaps in the Switched I/O ports ($40-$4F) Revision 9.
- Improved the vertical centering for VGA modes, you need to realign the image screen after the update.
- Improved VDP wait controller, Sunrise logo works faster now but the graphic glitches are not yet fixed.
- Improved tMegaSD function to be able to start "Xak Precious Package: The Tower of Gazzel" with SofaRunIt.

- Sometimes random glitches or other strange issues could be caused by the optimizations of Quartus II.
  In these situations it is suggested to recompile the project by replacing 'emsx_top.qsf' (balanced technique)
  with the alternive 'emsx_top.qsf.area'.
