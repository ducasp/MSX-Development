ESEPS2 Specifications
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Introductions
    ESEPS2 has two built-in keymaps, one corresponding to the MSX native one-to-one 
    keymap that corresponds one-to-one to MSX native. The other is a keymap that 
    converts different layouts to MSX native MSX native keymaps.
    These are switched by the Kmap signal.
    
        Kmap = 0: Keymap with one-to-one correspondence to MSX native.
        Kmap = 1: Keymap with transformation.

    The standard keymap.vhd is as follows.

        Kmap = 0: Japanese keyboard layout.
        Kmap = 1: English keyboard layout.

    Using Kmap = 1 allows an English keyboard to be used in OCM can be used in OCM 
    with Japanese MSX BIOS. You can type the characters as they are stamped on the keys.

(2) Constraints
    [1] Handling of multiple keys of the same type
        The PS/2 keyboard has multiple CTRL and SHIFT keys.
        The MSX also has one SHIFT key on each side, but the hardware configuration 
        treats these keys as the same key.
        ESEPS2 is configured to treat left CTRL/right CTRL and left SHIFT/right SHIFT 
        as the same key regardless of the value of the Kmap signal, but as a PS/2 
        keyboard it sends signals as separate keys.

            (a) Left  SHIFT press
            (b) Right SHIFT press
            (c) Left  SHIFT unpress
            (d) Right SHIFT unpress

        When such a keystroke is performed, the real MSX finally recognizes that the 
        SHIFT key is released at the point (d), but ESEPS2 recognizes that the SHIFT 
        key is released at the point (c).

    [2] Simultaneous push restrictions 1
        Some PS/2 keyboard products have a limit to the number of keys that can be 
        pressed simultaneously.
        When such keyboards reach the limit, the next key that can be pressed at the 
        same time sends a "released" signal even though the first key is not released.
        This is a limitation of the PS/2 keyboard and cannot be remedied because the 
        ESEPS2 cannot recognize it.

    [3] Simultaneous push restrictions 2
        Some PS/2 keyboard products have limitations on the key combinations that can 
        be pressed simultaneously. For example, some keyboards do not support the 
        simultaneous pressing of [←] + [↑] + [SPACE].
        Such keyboards will either send a false code saying that the first key was 
        "released" when the combination is not possible, or they will not send the key 
        code in the first place.
        This is a limitation of the PS/2 keyboard and cannot be remedied because ESEPS2 
        cannot recognize it.
        As for [←] + [↑] + [SPACE], since this combination is often used in games, the 
        [Left WIN] and [Right WIN] keys can be used as [SPACE] as an alternative.
        Pressing [←] + [↑] + [RIGHT WIN] will have the desired effect.

    [4] Limitation of Kmap = 1
        Because of the mapping realized by converting key codes, there are restrictions 
        on key combinations that can be pressed at the same time.
        For example, in the Japanese layout, the key corresponding to the symbol @ is [@].
        On the other hand, in the English layout, the key corresponding to the symbol @ 
        is [SHIFT] + [2].
        On a Japanese layout keyboard, the symbol @ and the letter w can be entered 
        simultaneously. Simply press [@][W] at the same time.
        If you are using Japanese MSX-BASIC with a Japanese-layout keyboard, you can 
        input the symbol @ and the letter w at the same time by pressing [@][W][W] at 
        the same time.
        Can input @w@w@w@w@w@w@w by pressing [@] and [W] at the same time.
        However, when using an English layout keyboard with Kmap = 1, the simultaneous 
        pressing of [SHIFT] + [2] and [W] results in the input of @W@W@W@W@W@W.
        Since "w" and "W" are assigned to the same bit in the MSX key matrix, this is 
        not a major problem in commercial games that directly handle the MSX key matrix, 
        but in MSX-BASIC programs that accept input in INPUT, INPUT$, or INKEY$, 
        this will have no effect. However, this is not a major problem for MSX-BASIC 
        programs that accept input with INPUT, INPUT$, or INKEY$.
        The SHIFT key in the Japanese layout and the English layout cannot be completely 
        converted in principle because of the problem of the combination with the symbol 
        keys, which are handled differently.
